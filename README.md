# Visualisation-Flights

Using data got from RITA, that shows flight delays and performance from September 2016 to September 2017. I will analyse number of delayed flights by airport showing in a US map with points that shows location of airports with a bubble of a radio proportional to the sum of delayed flights.

Project Steps
Step Five - Get Feedback
Share your visualization with at least 3 other people and document their feedback. There are many ways to get feedback, and more feedback is generally better! Here are some options.

Share your visualization with others in person and have them think aloud as they read and explore the graphic so you can document what stands out to them and how they interpret the graphic.
Share a link to your repository in the discussions and ask others to share constructive criticisms. Be sure to offer advice to others who are seeking feedback too!
Create and share a Gist, which contains an index.html file, data file, and any .js or .css files). Directions for creating and sharing a Gist can be found at http://bl.ocks.org/.

You might need to ask specific questions to prompt the reader. Here are some questions to help you. You can, of course, ask others.

What do you notice in the visualization?
What questions do you have about the data?
What relationships do you notice?
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?
