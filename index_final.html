        <h1>Flights Delayed 2006-2016</h1>
        <p>The dataset contains information on United States flight information from RITA for January 2006 to January 2016. This visualisation focus on flight delayed for major airports in US, selected following criteria of Bureau of Transportation Statistics. There is no special focus on the cause of the delayed but on sum of total delayed flights. I would like to focus this visualisation on airports location and compare trends of airports in the same state, I've found different trends depending on the state. In addition, you can tell from this data that in general there is a reduction on the sum of delayed flights that could be due to the fact that flight regulation are more strict than before.</p>
        <p>For instance, airports on Illinois, Texas, Florida and California seems to maintain a similar trend in this period. On the other hand, airports that belongs to Virginia and New York states shows different trends to each other. For instance, Washington Dulles International decreases its flight delayed in comparison to Ronald Reagan Washington National in years 2015 and 2016. Same happens in New York; in the last 2 years JFK seems to performance better than La Guardia.</p>
        <p>In order to interact with this data, you can select years button to see the total sum of flight delayed on each airport and the distribution of flight that were delayed each month, in order to see the impact on high seasons.</p>

        <div id="map"><p>This map shows distribution of airports and their sum of total delayed flights on each aiport for selected year. Also, you can see sum of min delayed by each cause, which are because of weather, NAS(National Aviation System), Security, Carrier and Late aircraft delay</p></div>
